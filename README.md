# Overview

This is an attempt to consolidate my thoughts and help organize technical information that interests me. There are many one time articles that I write both at work and for myself which gets lost over time.

## About me

	Principal engineer
	Atlassian

Building and solving problems interests me. Over the years, I have limited the problem space to software development. If there is one word to describe my interests, it is **"tinker"**.

My experience in software development spreading across domains and technologies has helped me develop a deeper understanding of computing and offer unique insights.

Fully hands on, I spend most of my time in design and implementation of critical distributed software.

Link to my [Professional resume](resume.md) covering work across domains and technologies.
